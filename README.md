# Numerical-Distributions
Numerical frequency distribution with an interval size of 20 and calculate the cumulative relative frequency.

This repository contains three implementations of the same data analysis task using different tools.

What Each Solution Does:

- Groups salaries using the formula: FLOOR((salary - 10) / 20) * 20 + 10. This assigns each salary to a range like 70–90, 90–110, etc.

- Counts how many salaries fall into each range

- Calculates the cumulative relative frequency as a percentage

- Outputs a summary table
